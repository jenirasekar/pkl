in most tutorial basic web programming, the very first thing we do is showing "Hello, World!" 
in web browser. how to do it? we use html language, let's follow the steps!
1. open your favourite text editor, as an example i use visual studio code on pc or laptop
2. when youre already in the app, create new file with click New File
3. then select a language in the first row, select html
4. start the first row, type <!DOCTYPE html> in order to program knows that code will run html type
5. press Enter button to give it a break for second row then start the tag <html> and end with </html>
6. in between those 2 tags, give a break and add tag <head> and close the tag with </head>
7. in the tag head, also create the tag title, which is <title></title> and type Basic HTML in between, that tag will
appear on the top of the tab as a title
8. after that, create tag body under the tag head, the tag is <body></body>, where the tag will show
the content from web that we program 
9. in tag body add tag <p></p> for showing paragraph. from that we can type "Hello, World!" in between those tags
10. finally, the last step but not least. save the program we made. we will be directed to file explorer, then create a folder 
11. name the file in thr folder with basichtml.html. why .html? because that extension will use for program to read so program know
the output is html
12. to see the output, back to text editor and click f5. otomatically direct to web browser and "Hello, World!" will appear

so, that is how to show "Hello, Wold!" in the web browser. keep learning bcs there is still a long way down :)
